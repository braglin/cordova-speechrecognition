Android XSpeechRecognizer plugin for Cordova/Phonegap
===================================

This plugin is based on the following implementations:
[https://github.com/macdonst/SpeechRecognitionPlugin]SpeechRecognitionPlugin
[https://github.com/poiuytrez/SpeechRecognizer]SpeechRecognizer

I wasn't able to implement the first plugin at first, the SpeechRecognizer was a good start, but I didn't want the google dialog to popup when the mic was activated.
